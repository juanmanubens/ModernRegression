## Papers:
- **Generalized Additive Model (GAM) Paper**, using professor salaries data base R package, _'car'_, originally featured in the book, _An R Companion to Applied Regression_ by Fox J. and Weisberg, S. in 2011.

- **Classification & Regression Trees (CART) Paper**, using data from the federal system during the Clinton Administration, and includes all homicide cases for which it was legally permitted to seek the death penalty. The data were collected to consider federal death penalty charging practices with the goal of possible subsequent reform.
